### Zoom limitation

By default, the minimum and maximum zoom levels are set to `0.25` and `3.0`, respectively. These limitations are convenient not to show the objects too small or too large.

Set the minimum and maximum zoom levels.

```javascript
  zoom: {
    max: 2.0,
    min: 0.5
  },
```

### Background style

By default, the field has a border and radial gradient background.

```javascript
  style: "border: solid 1px silver; background: radial-gradient(white, silver);"
```
